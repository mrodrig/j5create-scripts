# j5create Scripts for the USB 3.0 to HDMI Adapter

## reset-usb-monitor
This script kills the driver used by the adapter.  After running this script, simply unplug and reconnect the USB to HDMI adapter to connect the display again.

I created this script to reset the driver after encountering a few screen freezes on the monitor being driven by this adapter.  Running this script and reconnecting the device has always fixed the issue for me.

## Note
Additional scripts will be added as they are developed (if additional functionality is required or issues occur).
